WRITEUP: EVIDENCE HANDLING DOING IT THE RIGHT WAY

The course starts with the name EVIDENCE HANDLING DOING IT THE RIGHT WAY, we are introduced to Mr. Brian Dykstra who is the CEO of Atlantic data forensics, with a background as co-founder of Mandiant now called as FireEye Mandiant. He started his career as a contract with the FBI academy, Quantico as cybercrime instructor, and also indulged in the military intelligence department of US.
Next there is an introduction to the Atlantic Data forensics company with is related to computer forensics of civil and criminal litigations and was founded in 2007, with headquarters at instructor, it has offices in Denver and Detroit which serves for internal corporates and HR investigations also does response training and exercises.
This course requires just an internet connected computer and eagerness to learn about evidence collection. Target audience include incident responders and IT and forensic professionals.
Starting off with the course we are introduced to basic that is treat all like evidence i.e. it is advised to never ever go for shortcuts in evidence collection and documentation process as rush may cause narrowing of viewpoint and missing of important details.
Computer evidence is also defined under the federal rules of evidence as of three types as
Hearsay-Personal information such as types input
Non-Hearsay -Records created by a process that doesn’t require human interference such as logs
Mixed-Emil with header generated by computer and content generated by human
Next, we move on for authenticating the evidence which has a variety of methods including those of authenticating by person having direct knowledge, or any expert comparison. While following chain of custody also helps in authenticating evidence forensics methods include comparing of hash values such as MD5 or SHA1, even comparing the serial numbers and metadata alongside log files help us keep authenticity of evidence.
Talking more into we are introduced to the Best Evidence Rule that has some predefined set of conditions to be followed they are as presentation of the original evidence since it is the best evidence unless it is unavailable at the moment then only copies, notes or testimony be used.
Also the printouts and the data seen on monitor are considered as evidence and the third one when this rule comes handy when we have lots of data as in case of complex database backed applications , real time systems or systems having too much data for practical collection we can’t submit the whole bunch of data rather we either need to prepare a detailed report or document the next details to original one without altering the evidence in the best possible way.
One of the major steps is documentation i.e. Producing a precise detail of all the evidences found. It is the step prior to the collecting data as the forensic people starts collecting the evidence as soon as they reach the site so this may be a matter of big concern if any evidence is misplaced or not recorded during documentation. A better option is to carry a standard form to collect the details of evidence and fill in it also it must include the state of systems such as mobile, laptops whether off or on, note down if it died during process and specify if it was restarted or its image was created.
Improvement can be done by also including the system failures or errors if any and a person who reviews the documents side by side.

 Now things must to be included in the documentation to discard any chances of missing evidences. Following table shows the major things must to be kept:


What to document	Brief description
•	Date/Time
•	Location
•	Custodian	Current date and time while collecting evidence, location with respect to surroundings also, Primary user of system
•	Serial Number
•	Part Number
•	Inventory Number	Numbers addressed to keep a check on all evidences whether all are collected or not including serial number of systems also
•	Method of collection
•	Name of person collecting
•	Name of person documenting	Describes method whether image form, photograph etc. name of person collecting documenting
•	Description of item
•	POC of item
•	POC Contact info	Written description and the point of contact to analyse the evidences properly
•	Case#
•	Evidence#
•	Hash value	Generated to identify quickly the case and evidences amongst huge amount of data
Also prove Integrity of data
•	Evidence storage location
•	Evidence storage file name	Used to quickly search any item in case of need and proper storage
•	IMEI for phones 
•	I serial keys for USB
•	Time zones	For uniquely identifying the phones and USB also for ensuring if evidences collected I different time zones
•	Passcodes
•	Encryption keys
•	Clock Deviation	These are necessary if any passcode or encryption available also what the clock in the system



The most major aspect lands here i.e. The Chain of Custody, it is one use to track the original evidence and involves documentation as such the transfer details including the date, content and to the authority it was transferred to. Collecting the signature of sender and recipient too adding to which there are many forms of chain of custody either using forms or multiple documents are useful.
Storing the evidence is also an important step which comes after the collection of evidences so the better form is to store data offline with less network access and to prevent data losses due to attacks such as ransomware where they encrypt the data and ask some funds to relieve that to you again or provide key to decrypt the data. In case data. When encryptions are used there must be good and multiple storages of keys at different location prevent losses of availability when needed. Tampering the evidence is a major concern for storage of data it means that they need to be stored more securely too, it can be done by using latex gloves and storing the evidence in faraday bags.
Securing the evidence can be done by using high security cabinets or steel cages while travelling also it need to be secured by incorporating the access-based systems, the HD video cameras, alarms systems. An asset tracking system helps us keep a note of any change if happened to evidence usually in case of auditing, while the best possible case is to maintain a human control over the evidence while travelling.
A lot of problems are faced in handling the evidences some of them include incomplete or incorrect documentation, chain of custody is broken, lost encryption key, or the worst case may be the loosing of evidence itself due to poor control and documentation. Due to these problems it becomes difficult to pass data to any agency or review the whole case, sometimes it may take a huge amount of time to analyse the situation.
Summarising the above writeup we learnt how to collect evidence, store it securely and perform documentation. We also learnt that how chain of custody proves a major aspect in solving cases precisely and accurately and how even the smallest o mistakes or recklessness can lead to devastating loss resources used in forensic.
